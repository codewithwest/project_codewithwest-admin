# Admin Panel Release Notes: Electron V2.0.1

This patch release addresses critical production access issues and refines the application's branding and developer experience.

## 🛠 Bug Fixes & Production Readiness

### 🔐 Production Authorization Fix
- **Middleware Update**: Resolved `401 Unauthorized` errors when accessing Messages or Integrations in production.
- **Synchronized Protection**: Added `getContactMessages`, `getIntegrations`, `createIntegration`, and `revokeIntegration` to the `ProtectedMutationsAndQueries` list in the Go backend to ensure session validation is correctly applied across all environments.

### 🚀 Boot Performance & UX
- **Stealth Startup**: Disabled the automatic opening of Chrome DevTools on application launch for a more professional user experience.
- **Security Clean-up**: Removed debug console logs containing sensitive API tokens from the Apollo client configuration.

## 🎨 UI & Branding Refinements

### 🖼 Robust Asset Loading
- **Electron Compatibility**: Refactored logo resolution in the sidebar to use more reliable asset paths.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Implemented a fail-safe image loader that gracefully handles missing local assets by falling back to remote branding.
- **Visual Framing**: Enhanced the logo container with subtle gradients and borders for better integration with the glassmorphism theme.

## 📦 Deployment Reminders
- **Integration Sinc**: Ensure that production integration tokens are synchronized with the environment variables.
- **Build Update**: Run `npm run make` to package these fixes into your latest desktop distribution.
