# Admin Panel Release Notes: Electron V2

This release marks a significant milestone: the full migration of the Admin Panel from Flutter to a high-performance **Electron + React** desktop application, accompanied by a complete premium visual overhaul.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 💻 Platform Migration
- **Electron Architecture**: Transitioned from Flutter to a modern Electron desktop environment powered by **Vite** and **React**.
- **Improved Performance**: Leveraged native rendering and Turbopack for near-instant build and reload speeds.
- **Enhanced Routing**: Implemented `HashRouter` to ensure seamless navigation within the Electron file protocol.

### 🎨 Premium Design System (Glassmorphism)
- **Unified Aesthetic**: Implemented a "Glassmorphism" design language with backdrop-blur effects and 3xl rounded glass containers.
- **Dynamic Feedback**:
    - **ErrorState**: Replaced raw errors with beautiful, context-aware error components (Unauthorized vs. General Errors).
    - **EmptyState**: Redesigned empty data views with premium icons and animations.
- **Enhanced Navigation**: 
    - Added active tab highlighting with gradient accent bars.
    - Updated sidebar with the official CodeWithWest logo and branding.

### 🔐 Security & Technical Refinement
- **Dual-Token Architecture**: Segregated authentication headers:
    - `Authorization`: Exclusively for Admin User Sessions.
    - `X-API-Key`: Dedicated to external Integration tokens.
- **Unified Login**: Simplified the login process with a single "Email or Username" identifier field.
- **Modular Components**: Refactored complex components (Projects, Messages, Integrations) for better maintainability and consistent UI.

### 🛠 New Features & Management
- **Integrations Management**: Full CRUD suite for API client tokens, including generation and revocation.
- **Admin Messages**: Dedicated inbox to view and manage user messages from the portfolio site.
- **Projects Management**: Harmonized listing page with Grid and List view toggles.

## 📦 CI/CD & Deployment
- **GitHub Pipeline**: Added `release.yml` for automated Electron builds.
- **Environment Injection**: Automated injection of `VITE_API_URL` and `VITE_API_TOKEN` during the build process.
- **Native Packaging**: Configured Electron Forge to generate `.deb` packages for Linux distribution.

## 🔧 Internal Fixes & Polishing
- **Apollo Configuration**: Centralized API client setup with automatic header handling.
- **Icon System**: Standardized on `lucide-react` for a crisp, modern visual language.
- **UX Micro-interactions**: Added group hover states, pulse animations, and gradient glows across all cards.
