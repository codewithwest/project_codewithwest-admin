# v2.0.3 - Full Projects CRUD & Architectural Refinement

This release completes the Projects management module, enabling administrators to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a premium, secure workflow.

## 🚀 Projects Management (CRUD)

### **Full Lifecycle Control**
- **Project Editing**:
  - Introduced the `UpdateProject` mutation and resolver logic in the backend.
  - Added a responsive **Edit Drawer** in the admin panel, automatically pre-filling existing project data for seamless updates.
- **Project Deletion**:
  - Implemented the `DeleteProject` mutation with atomic removal from MongoDB.
  - Added a **Trash** action with a native confirmation safety check to prevent accidental data loss.
- **Unified Form Logic**: The project creation workflow has been upgraded to a dual-purpose form that handles both high-end creation and precision editing.

### **UI & Interaction Updates**
- Added **Edit** and **Delete** actions to all project cards in both Grid and List views.
- Retained the **Premium 3D Loader** experience across all new mutation states (Saving, Updating, Deleting).
- Optimized list synchronization via Apollo `refetchQueries`, ensuring UI stays current without manual reloads.

## 🛠 Backend Fixes & Improvements
- **GraphQL Type Safety**: Resolved a critical type mismatch in the `DeleteProject` mutation, enabling it to correctly return scalar integer IDs.
- **Protected Mutations**: Secured all new project operations behind the `AdminAuthRequired` middleware.
- **Project Reusables**: Refactored input validation to support both creation and update flows, reducing code duplication.

## 📦 Maintenance
- **Version Bump**: Bumped to `v2.0.3`.
- **Cleaner Workspace**: Updated `.gitignore` to better handle compiled binaries and temporary development files (`bin/`, `tmp/`).
