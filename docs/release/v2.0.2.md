# v2.0.2 - Premium Refetching UX & UI Harmonization

The focus of this release is a significant upgrade to the user experience across the Admin Panel, introducing high-end visual feedback and seamless data synchronization.

## ✨ Premium UI/UX Overhaul

### **Premium 3D Loader**
- Introduced a state-of-the-art **`PremiumLoader`** component featuring:
  - 3D glassmorphism effects with `framer-motion`.
  - Dynamic particle animations and glowing orbital rings.
  - Perspective-based rotations for a high-end, premium feel.
  - Context-aware labels like "Decrypting Vault", "Cataloging Projects", and "Validating Credentials".

### **Background Refetching Logic**
- Implemented **`networkStatus`**-aware data fetching logic across all major components.
- Added a subtle, animated 3D sync indicator at the top of pages during background updates.
- This ensures users stay informed of data changes without interrupting their workflow or causing full-page shifts.

### **Persistent Headers & Layout Stability**
- Refactored layout logic to ensure **Page Headers** remain persistent and visible at all times.
- Eliminated "jumping" layouts during initial data fetches by placing loading states within the content area.
- Harmonized all interaction points (buttons, forms) to use consistent loading indicators.

## 🛠 Enhanced Components
- **Messages**: Integrated premium background refetching and sync stream indicators.
- **Projects**: Modernized with cataloging animations and persistent header support.
- **Project Categories**: Unified with taxonomy update indicators and high-end loaders.
- **Access Requests**: Added credential validation animations for a secure feel.
- **Admin Users**: Implemented directory initialization animations.
- **Integrations**: Updated with vault decryption visuals and unified loading patterns.

## 🚀 Performance & Technical Improvements
- Added custom 3D CSS utilities to `index.css` for GPU-accelerated animations.
- Improved Apollo Client hook configurations to support `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange`.
- Standardized import patterns and resolved architectural discrepancies between components.
